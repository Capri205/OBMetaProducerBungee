# OBMetaProducerBungee

Minecraft BungeeCord plugin to gather meta data for use by external tools, utilities and monitoring.
Detects player server and disconnect events and writes these to a file.

This is very specific to our needs and setup so of not much value to anyone out there I would think.
This is also the complete Eclipse project so it should import into Eclipse (I was using Oxygen.3.a Release 4.7.3a).

Compiled for BungeeCord 1.17 and Java 16.
