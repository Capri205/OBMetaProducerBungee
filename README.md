# OBMetaProducerBungee

Minecraft BungeeCord plugin to gather meta data for use by external tools, utilities and monitoring.
Detects player server and disconnect events and writes these to a file.

This is very specific to our needs and setup so of not much value to anyone out there I would think.

Compiled for BungeeCord 1.18 and Java 17.
